    "### 🔍 How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select a List Section**\n",
    "   You choose which part of your MyAnimeList to work with (e.g., \"Plan to Watch\", \"Watching\", \"Completed\").\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Data Enrichment via MyAnimeList API**\n",
    "   After sorting, the notebook queries the **MyAnimeList API v2** to enrich each entry with additional details such as:\n",
    "   - ✅ Title and description\n",
    "   - 🎬 Number of episodes or chapters\n",
    "   - 🔁 Whether it has sequels/prequels\n",
